Sukun Regenerative Culture
Where Peace Nurtures Life
 
A faith- and culture-rooted movement for ecological and cultural regeneration in Sylhet, Bangladesh.
We cultivate inner peace (sukūn) and outward renewal (tajdīd) through living education, regenerative farming, and community stewardship — restoring the bond between soul, soil, and society.

About Sukun Regenerative Culture
Sukun Regenerative Culture is the heart and philosophy of the Sukun ecosystem — a coordinating framework that guides all our initiatives. It integrates Islamic principles of Tawḥīd (unity), Amānah (trust), and Khilāfah (stewardship) with modern permaculture and regenerative design.
In a time when chemical farming, cultural fatigue, and rural migration are weakening our relationship with land and tradition, Sukun offers a living pathway back to balance. We bridge indigenous wisdom and contemporary regenerative science, so land can heal, livelihoods can return, and learning can restore dignity.
One Living System in Kulaura, Sylhet
Our work grows through a connected landscape:
•	Sukun Academy (7 acres) — the learning and design hub (planned)
•	Al Fajr Ecovillage (32 acres) — the living community and production sanctuary (planned)
Together they form a 39-acre regenerative ecosystem rooted in faith, ecology, and cooperation.
And through partnership:
•	Darul Hayah Regenerative Farm (15 acres, Gulni, Sylhet) — a collaborative farm-learning site now entering early implementation.

Ecological & Cultural Themes
Ecological Regeneration
Through regenerative farming, we heal soil, water, and biodiversity using permaculture and proper land care.
Cultural Renewal
Through living education, we renew traditional wisdom and faith- and culture-rooted values for resilient, conscious communities.
Community Impact
Through community stewardship, we build ethical livelihoods, cooperation, and long-term social–ecological wellbeing.

The Four Pillars of Sukun
These pillars guide how we learn, live, and regenerate together.
1) ʿIlm — Knowledge (Learning & Applied Wisdom)
Cultivating Qur’anic living, ecological literacy, and applied understanding so regeneration starts in the heart and moves into the land.
2) Mahārāt — Skills (Practical Abilities)
Hands-on training in permaculture, natural farming, natural building, traditional crafts, and service leadership.
3) Awqāf — Economy (Sacred Commons & Ethical Livelihoods)
Building a just cooperative economy where land and core assets are held in waqf — sacred commons, enabling shared prosperity and long-term ecological protection.
4) Jamāʿah — Community (Cooperative Network)
A nurturing, Shūrā-guided (consultative ecological leadership) community culture rooted in worship, mutual support, inclusion, and care for the vulnerable.

Our Projects — Emerging Initiatives in the Sukun Ecosystem
Three interconnected initiatives are being developed to bring ecological and cultural regeneration into daily life. Two are still in the visioning and land-securing phase, and one has just begun implementation. Follow our journey as these seeds grow into living realities.
 


Sukun Academy — Bangladesh (Future Project)
